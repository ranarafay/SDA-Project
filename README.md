Hostel Management System, using JFX and MYSQL.

#Introduction:
The system is designed to handle a variety of hostel management-related activities. It will enable remote management of all fundamental operations held during managing hostel. As the system uses a database to store data, it will ensure data security and management more efficiently than manual data management. This will aid organisations in managing data in an ordered manner.
The system's goal was to make it simple for management and the wards to perform daily tasks.
#Interface:
Java FX is implemented to enhance system interaction, and a responsive graphical user interface was created keeping in view all specified standards into consideration. The interface of the system is built in a way that it is capable to handle and react to all possible scenarios.

#Conclusion:
The business logic layer is designed and implemented keeping in view all Object-Oriented Programming Principles. Application uses all necessary design patterns accordingly. 
System can be used to mange Hostels but it specifies the use cases for Army Boys Hostels and is designed in favour of ABH management.
